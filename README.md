📊 Insights & Observations
🧍 Demographics
Customers are evenly split by gender in terms of sales volume.

The 30–40 and 50–60 age groups generated the highest number of orders.

Older customers (70+) contribute minimally to overall order volume.

📆 Monthly Trends
Sales ramp up significantly in March and April, dip in May, and peak sharply in December.

Low activity in February and October could be seasonal or campaign-related.

🛍️ Category Insights
Mobiles & Tablets outperform all other categories by a large margin.

Appliances and Entertainment follow distantly, with moderate revenue.

Computing and Women’s Fashion see minimal traction, suggesting possible inventory or marketing issues.

✅ Recommendations
Capitalize on December trends: Leverage the high sales potential in December with focused holiday campaigns and stock planning.

Boost engagement in low-performing months: Launch promotions or limited-time offers in February and October to counter the sales dip.

Explore underperforming categories: Investigate why categories like Women’s Fashion and Computing are underperforming — pricing, visibility, or product-market fit.

Focus on mid-age buyers: Tailor campaigns and product bundles to the 30–60 age group, which shows the highest order volume.

Consider targeted campaigns by gender: With a nearly equal gender split, ensure marketing materials are inclusive but also test gender-specific campaigns to boost conversions.

Expand category diversification: Consider investing in categories that align with customer preferences revealed in high-performing segments.
